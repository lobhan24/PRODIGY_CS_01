The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each character in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
Python Program for Caesar Cipher
To use this program, simply run it and enter the text you want to encrypt when prompted. Then, enter the shift value (the number of positions to shift each letter in the alphabet). The program will display the encrypted text and then decrypt it back to the original text.
Please note: This program preserves the case of the letters (uppercase/lowercase) and leaves non-alphabetical characters unchanged.
